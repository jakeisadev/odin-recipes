# odin-recipes

This is going to be a short project about recipes. I believe TOP will be providing
recipes to use, but if they don't, I will obviously be inserting my own.

Fun Fact: I spent 25 minutes attempting to clone this repo into my existing "/repos" directory.
I kept getting multiple errors until I realized that I didn't have the cmd "git clone" before
my ssh key copied code from Github. Absolutely astounding if you ask me.
