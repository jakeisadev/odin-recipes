      <li>¼ cup margarine</li>
      <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 cup milk</li>
      <li>½ cup vegetable broth, or as needed</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons white wine</li>
      <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>1 cup light ricotta cheese</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
      <li>1 egg white</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>2 cups coarsely shredded carrots</li>
      <li>2 cups coarsely chopped zucchini</li>
      <li>1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained</li>
      <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna in the
        boiling water,<br />
        stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 8
        minutes. Drain.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Melt margarine in a skillet over low heat; cook and stir flour, salt,
        and pepper into the<br />
        melted margarine until smooth and bubbling, 2 to 3 minutes. Add milk and
        broth into<br />
        flour mixture, stirring constantly; bring sauce to a boil. Stir wine
        into sauce and<br />
        remove from heat. Stir Parmesan cheese into sauce until smooth.
      </li>
      <li>Whisk ricotta cheese, egg, and egg white together in a bowl.</li>
      <li>
        Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; saute carrots,
        zucchini, and spinach<br />
        until just becoming tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir vegetable mixture into
        ricotta<br />
        mixture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Layer 1/3 the lasagna noodles, 1/3 the ricotta-vegetable mixture, and
        1/3 the<br />
        Parmesan sauce in a 9x13-inch baking dish; repeat layering 2 more times
        with<br />
        remaining ingredients, ending with a layer of mozzarella cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is lightly browned and bubbling,
        about 30<br />
        minutes.
      </li>
    </ol>
